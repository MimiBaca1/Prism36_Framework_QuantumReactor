## 1. Quaternion Kinematics for Gyroscopic Rings

Let the orientation of a gyroscopic ring be represented by a unit quaternion:

$$
q(t) = q_0(t) + q_1(t)i + q_2(t)j + q_3(t)k
$$

The angular velocity vector in the body frame is:

$$
\vec{\omega}(t) = [\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]
$$

The quaternion derivative is:

$$
\dot{q}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \, q(t) \otimes \Omega(t)
$$

Where:

$$
\Omega(t) = 0 + \omega_x i + \omega_y j + \omega_z k
$$

Here, âŠ— denotes quaternion multiplication. This governs the rotational evolution of the ring.

## 2. Quaternion-Based Field Potential

Define a quaternionic scalar field:

$$
\Phi(\vec{r}, t) = \phi_0(\vec{r}, t) + \phi_1(\vec{r}, t)i + \phi_2(\vec{r}, t)j + \phi_3(\vec{r}, t)k
$$

The quaternion gradient operator is defined as:

$$
\nabla_q = i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + j \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + k \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
$$

The field strength tensor (analogous to the electromagnetic field) is:

$$
F_q = \nabla_q \Phi
$$

This encodes spatial field variations and can be used to model plasma confinement and harmonic inversion zones.

## 3. Spinor Field Dynamics for Plasma Particles

Let $\psi$ be a two-component spinor field representing a confined plasma particle:

$$
\psi(\vec{r}, t) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\psi_1 \\
\psi_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Couple it to the quaternionic field via a gauge interaction:

$$
D_\mu \psi = \left( \partial_\mu + i A_\mu \right) \psi
$$

Where $A_\mu$ is derived from the quaternionic potential $\Phi$, and $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative.

The spinor field obeys a Dirac-like equation:

$$
(i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi = 0
$$

This models relativistic behavior and field coupling of charged particles in the reactor core.

## 4. Gyroscopic Energy and Stability

Rotational kinetic energy of a ring is given by:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} \, \vec{\omega}^T I \vec{\omega}
$$

Where $I$ is the moment of inertia tensor. Stability analysis involves computing:

**Precession frequency:**

$$
\Omega_p = \frac{L}{I \omega}
$$

**Nutation modes** are obtained via eigenvalues of the linearized system around equilibrium.

## 5. Prism36 Quaternionic Shell

Define 36 nodes $q_n$ on a closed quaternionic surface:

$$
q_n = a_n + b_n i + c_n j + d_n k, \quad n = 1, \dots, 36
$$

Impose symmetry constraints:

- Centered shell:  
  $$
  \sum_{n=1}^{36} q_n = 0
  $$

- Constant radius:  
  $$
  |q_n| = R
  $$

Field containment is modeled by enforcing:

$$
F_q(q_n) = 0
$$

on the shell boundary. This ensures harmonic inversion and confinement stability.
