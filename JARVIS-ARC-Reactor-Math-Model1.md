## 1. Quaternion Kinematics for Gyroscopic Rings

Let the orientation of a gyroscopic ring be represented by a unit quaternion:

$$
q(t) = q_0(t) + q_1(t)i + q_2(t)j + q_3(t)k
$$

The angular velocity vector in the body frame is:

$$
\vec{\omega}(t) = [\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]
$$

The quaternion derivative is:

$$
\dot{q}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \, q(t) \otimes \Omega(t)
$$

Where:

$$
\Omega(t) = 0 + \omega_x i + \omega_y j + \omega_z k
$$

Here, âŠ— denotes quaternion multiplication. This governs the rotational evolution of the ring.

## 2. Quaternion-Based Field Potential

Define a quaternionic scalar field:

$$
\Phi(\vec{r}, t) = \phi_0(\vec{r}, t) + \phi_1(\vec{r}, t)i + \phi_2(\vec{r}, t)j + \phi_3(\vec{r}, t)k
$$

The quaternion gradient operator is defined as:

$$
\nabla_q = i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + j \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + k \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
$$

The field strength tensor (analogous to the electromagnetic field) is:

$$
F_q = \nabla_q \Phi
$$

This encodes spatial field variations and can be used to model plasma confinement and harmonic inversion zones.
