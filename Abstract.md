Abstract: Quaternionic Encoding of Plasma Confinement in a Spinor-Coupled Quantum Reactor
This project explores a speculative framework for plasma confinement and field manipulation within a theoretical system, leveraging quaternionic algebra and spinor field theory. Quaternions, as four-dimensional hypercomplex numbers, offer a robust mathematical structure for modeling 3D rotational dynamics without singularities such as gimbal lock. Their norm-preserving properties make them ideal for encoding gyroscopic ring orientations and spatial field inversions.

Building on this, the reactor design incorporates spinor fields—mathematical entities fundamental to quantum mechanics and relativistic physics—to represent the quantum state of confined plasma particles. These spinors are coupled to quaternion-valued potential fields via gauge interactions, allowing for orientation-sensitive field behavior and phase-dependent energy modulation.

The encoding strategy includes:

Quaternion rotation matrices for gyroscopic dynamics

Quaternionic potential fields to model electromagnetic confinement geometries

Spinor field coupling to simulate quantum-level plasma behavior

While the model is speculative and not currently realized in mainstream fusion technology, it is grounded in credible mathematical physics. The goal is to inspire new ways of thinking about field interactions, confinement strategies, and the fusion of geometric and quantum principles in advanced energy systems.
