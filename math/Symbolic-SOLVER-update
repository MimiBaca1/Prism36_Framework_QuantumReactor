Symbolic Solver Update
We hit a snag in the symbolic computation: a matrix size mismatch while constructing the Dirac equation. The symbolic spinor field was defined as a column vector, while the gamma matrices were square—leading to a shape incompatibility. Classic tensor algebra hiccup.

The problematic equation looked like this:

Code
(i γ^μ ∂_μ - m) ψ = 0
Where:

γ^μ are the gamma matrices (4×4)

ψ is the spinor field (4×1)

m is the mass term

∂_μ denotes partial derivatives with respect to spacetime coordinates

The mismatch occurred during symbolic expansion, where the matrix multiplication between γ^μ and ψ wasn't properly aligned. This caused symbolic solvers to throw shape errors during simplification and eigenmode extraction.

## Fix Strategy
To resolve this:

Recast ψ as a symbolic column vector with indexed components: ψ = [ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃, ψ₄]^T

Ensure γ^μ matrices are explicitly defined with symbolic entries

Use Einstein summation convention carefully when expanding γ^μ ∂_μ ψ

Validate tensor shapes before applying symbolic simplification

Once aligned, we’ll extract eigenmode equations from the Dirac operator and proceed to solve them symbolically.
