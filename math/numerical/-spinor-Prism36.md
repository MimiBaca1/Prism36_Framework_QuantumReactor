# 2. Numerical Modeling: Spinor Field in Prism36 Shell

We simulate the system numerically using Python (NumPy/SciPy or FEniCS) to solve the Dirac equation on a discretized Prism36 geometry.

---

## üß± Geometry & Mesh

- Define **Prism36** as a 3D mesh with 36 nodes
- Assign quaternionic field values $\Phi_n$ at each node
- Use **finite element method (FEM)** to discretize space

---

## üî¢ Discretized Dirac Equation

We solve the eigenvalue problem:

$$
H \psi_n = E_n \psi_n
$$

Where:

- $H$ is a matrix derived from the discretized covariant derivative $D_\mu$ and quaternionic field values
- $\psi_n$ are the spinor eigenmodes
- $E_n$ are the corresponding energy eigenvalues

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

- Use **NumPy/SciPy** for matrix construction and eigenvalue solvers
- Use **FEniCS** or **COMSOL** for mesh generation and FEM discretization
- Quaternionic field $\Phi_n$ can be encoded as a vector field with 4 components per node
