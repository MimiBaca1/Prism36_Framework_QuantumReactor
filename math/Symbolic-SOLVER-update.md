Symbolic Solver Update
We hit a snag in the symbolic computation: a matrix size mismatch while constructing the Dirac equation. The symbolic spinor field was defined as a column vector, while the gamma matrices were square—leading to a shape incompatibility. Classic tensor algebra hiccup.

The problematic equation looked like this:

Code
(i γ^μ ∂_μ - m) ψ = 0
Where:

γ^μ are the gamma matrices (4×4)

ψ is the spinor field (4×1)

m is the mass term

∂_μ denotes partial derivatives with respect to spacetime coordinates

The mismatch occurred during symbolic expansion, where the matrix multiplication between γ^μ and ψ wasn't properly aligned. This caused symbolic solvers to throw shape errors during simplification and eigenmode extraction.

## Fix Strategy
To resolve this:

Recast ψ as a symbolic column vector with indexed components: ψ = [ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃, ψ₄]^T

Ensure γ^μ matrices are explicitly defined with symbolic entries

Use Einstein summation convention carefully when expanding γ^μ ∂_μ ψ

Validate tensor shapes before applying symbolic simplification

Once aligned, we’ll extract eigenmode equations from the Dirac operator and proceed to solve them symbolically.

## EXPLAINATION SUMMARY
# Context: Symbolic Dirac Equation in Prism36 Shell
We were modeling:

(
𝑖
𝛾
𝜇
∂
𝜇
−
𝑚
)
𝜓
=
0
Where:

𝛾
𝜇
: Gamma matrices (4×4), representing spacetime Clifford algebra

∂
𝜇
: Partial derivatives with respect to spacetime coordinates

𝜓
: Spinor field (4×1), representing quantum states

𝑚
: Mass term

This equation governs the behavior of spin-½ particles in quantum field theory—perfect for modeling symbolic plasma behavior, eigenmode resonance, or cognitive phase transitions in your vessel.

⚠️ The Hiccup: Tensor Shape Mismatch
The symbolic solver (likely sympy) couldn’t align the shapes of 
𝛾
𝜇
∂
𝜇
 and 
𝜓

This happened because:

𝛾
𝜇
 was treated as a matrix

∂
𝜇
𝜓
 was not properly expanded as a vector of derivatives

Einstein summation wasn’t applied correctly

## Fix Strategy (Recap + Extension)

#1) Define ψ as a symbolic column vector
CODE: psi = Matrix([psi1, psi2, psi3, psi4])

#2)  Define each γ^μ explicitly:
Use symbolic 4×4 matrices for γ⁰, γ¹, γ², γ³
You can use Dirac representation or Weyl basis

#3) Define ∂_μ ψ as a vector of symbolic derivative
CODE: d_psi = [diff(psi, t), diff(psi, x), diff(psi, y), diff(psi, z)]

#4) Apply Einstein summation manually:
CODE: dirac_operator = I * (gamma0 * d_psi[0] + gamma1 * d_psi[1] + gamma2 * d_psi[2] + gamma3 * d_psi[3]) - m * Identity(4)

#5) Construct the full equation:
CODE: equation = dirac_operator * psi

#6) Solve symbolically:
Use solve(equation, [psi1, psi2, psi3, psi4]) or extract eigenmodes
