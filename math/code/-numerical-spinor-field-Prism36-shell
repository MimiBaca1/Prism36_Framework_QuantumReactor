Discretized Dirac Equation
We solve: $$ H \psi_n = E_n \psi_n $$

Where 
𝐻
 is a matrix derived from discretized 
𝐷
𝜇
 and field values.
This gives you numerical eigenvalues and spinor
modes, which can be visualized or used to analyze
confinement stability

--- Begin code ---
  
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import eigh

# Define mesh and field
N = 36  # Prism36 nodes
A = np.random.rand(N, N)  # mock field coupling matrix
H = A + A.T  # symmetric Hamiltonian

# Solve eigenvalue problem
E, psi = eigh(H)

# Output eigenvalues and eigenmodes
print("Energy levels:", E)
print("Spinor modes:", psi)
