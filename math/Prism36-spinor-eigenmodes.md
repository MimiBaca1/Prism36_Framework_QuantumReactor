# Prism36 Symmetry & Spinor Eigenmodes

Let’s now explore how the symmetry of Prism36 affects the eigenmodes of the spinor field.

## 1. Prism36 Symmetry Group

Assume Prism36 has a discrete symmetry group $G \subset SO(3)$, possibly a subgroup like:

- Dihedral group $D_{18}$ (36 vertices = 18 edges × 2 ends)
- Or a polyhedral group with rotational symmetries

This symmetry constrains the spinor field $\psi(\vec{r})$ such that:

$$
\psi(g \cdot \vec{r}) = U(g) \psi(\vec{r}) \quad \forall g \in G
$$

Where $U(g)$ is a unitary representation of the group acting on spinors.

## 2. Spinor Field Eigenmode Equation

We solve the Dirac-like equation:

$$
(i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi = 0
$$

Subject to boundary conditions imposed by Prism36’s geometry. The eigenmodes $\psi_n$ satisfy:

$$
H \psi_n = E_n \psi_n
$$

Where $H$ is the Hamiltonian derived from the quaternionic field and $E_n$ are energy eigenvalues.

## 3. Symmetry-Induced Degeneracies

Due to symmetry:

- Certain eigenvalues $E_n$ will be degenerate (same energy, different modes)
- Eigenfunctions will transform under irreducible representations of $G$

This leads to:

- Mode classification by symmetry type
- Selection rules for transitions
- Stability zones in the reactor core

## 4. Numerical Simulation Strategy

To simulate:

- Discretize Prism36 into a mesh
- Encode quaternionic field $\Phi(\vec{r})$
- Solve Dirac equation numerically using finite element or spectral methods
- Extract eigenvalues and visualize spinor modes

**Tools:** Python (FEniCS, SciPy), COMSOL, or custom C++ solvers
