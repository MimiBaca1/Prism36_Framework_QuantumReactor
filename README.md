# Prism36 Quantum Reactor: A Multiversal Harmonic Energy System
# Prism36_Framework_QuantumReactor
A scientifically sound theoretical model proposing alternative formulations of spacetime geometry and quantum structure. Built on formal mathematics. A fresh take on fundamental physicsâ€”bridging mathematical elegance with speculative insight to challenge conventional paradigms. open to peer engagement.

## Summary

## ðŸ“˜ Theoretical Framework

This project explores the viability of a symmetry-protected quantum energy system based on multiversal harmonic resonance. The Prism36 shell is modeled as a 36-node lattice enforcing spinor field stability via group-theoretic constraints. The Mirtoe axis is treated as a topological singularity enabling energy transfer across dimensional boundaries. The system draws on principles from quantum field theory, zero-point energy, and nonlocal entanglement to propose a mechanism for extracting pure light energy from an inverse on universe(s).

While speculative, the mathematical structure is grounded in tensor calculus, eigenmode analysis, and topological symmetry. The goal is to simulate, refine, and eventually prototype a controllable energy conduit.


This repository documents the theoretical framework, simulation models, and control system logic for the Prism36 reactor. It is intended as a collaborative space for physicists, engineers, and speculative theorists exploring the frontier of multiversal energy systems.
