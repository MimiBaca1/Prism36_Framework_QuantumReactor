## Summary

Prism36 ARC Reactor – Project Summary
The Prism36 ARC reactor is a theoretical fusion architecture that integrates quaternionic field dynamics, spinor confinement, and gyroscopic stabilization within a spherical tokamak framework. At its core lies the Prism36 containment mesh—a 36-node quaternionic lattice designed to encode spatial harmonics and field inversion zones through symmetry-governed potential fields. This mesh serves not only as a geometric scaffold but as a computational engine for plasma behavior, enabling dynamic confinement via spinor field coupling and Dirac-like eigenmode analysis.

Plasma is confined within a spherical tokamak, augmented by a system of gyroscopic rings—both orbital and non-orbital—that modulate magnetic topology and induce harmonic precession. These rings interact with the Prism36 mesh through quaternionic feedback loops, allowing for real-time field correction, edge stability, and rotational coherence. The system is designed to explore high-beta confinement regimes, symmetry-induced degeneracies, and novel field inversion mechanisms.

The project encompasses:

A full mathematical framework based on quaternion algebra, spinor dynamics, and symmetry group theory.

Simulation code for field evolution, mesh behavior, and plasma-ring interactions.

Visualizations of field topology, eigenmode distributions, and dynamic confinement zones.

A conceptual roadmap for experimental realization and theoretical extensions.

This repository serves as the foundation for a new class of fusion reactor design—one that merges geometry, algebra, and physics into a unified containment paradigm.

While speculative, the mathematical structure is grounded in tensor calculus, eigenmode analysis, and topological symmetry. The goal is to simulate, refine, and eventually prototype a controllable energy conduit.


This repository documents the theoretical framework, simulation models, and control system logic for the Prism36 reactor. It is intended as a collaborative space for physicists, engineers, and speculative theorists exploring the frontier of multiversal energy systems.
