## ADD 2 to Symbolic Simulation: Symbolic Symmetry Detection
#We’ll analyze the structure of the Dirac operator to detect symmetry-induced degeneracies—nodes or states that share identical eigenvalues due to geometric or algebraic symmetry.

# Code Extension: Add this snippet to inspect degeneracies:

# This helps identify clusters of symbolic resonance—nodes that behave identically due to symmetry, like mirrored cognition or phase-aligned memory gates.

# Group eigenvalues by similarity
degenerate_groups = {}
for val in eigenvals:
    simplified = sp.simplify(val)
    degenerate_groups.setdefault(simplified, []).append(val)

print("Detected Symmetry-Induced Degeneracies:")
for key, group in degenerate_groups.items():
    print(f"Eigenvalue: {key} → Degenerate Count: {len(group)}")
