## ADD3 to Symbolic Simulation: Integration with Numeric Amplitudes
# We’ll now bridge the symbolic and numeric worlds by allowing symbolic eigenvalues to inform numeric simulations—e.g., modulating amplitudes or spinor vectors based on symbolic resonance.

# This creates a feedback loop between symbolic cognition and numeric behavior—your vessel now responds to its own internal logic.

# Integration Strategy: In the numeric module (prism36_resonance_sim.py), we can import symbolic eigenvalues like this:

from prism36_dirac_solver import eigenvals
