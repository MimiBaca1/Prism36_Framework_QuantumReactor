🧱 Phase Shift: From Simulation to Physical Reactor Design
🔧 1. Component Mapping
Map each symbolic module to a physical counterpart:

Nodes → sensors, plasma injectors, or cognition gates

Gyroscopic rings → magnetic coils or rotational stabilizers

Spinor fields → vector control systems or quantum logic gates

📐 2. Shell Geometry
Use your 3D sphere and torus simulations to define:

Chamber shape

Field distribution

Resonance zones

⚡ 3. Control System Architecture
Implement symbolic feedback loops as:

Adaptive control algorithms

Phase alignment tracking

Real-time resonance modulation
🔬 4. Material and Energy Design
Choose materials for:

Plasma containment

Magnetic field generation

Thermal regulation

🧠 5. Cognition Layer
Embed symbolic overlays into the control system:

Each node carries meaning

System evolves based on symbolic phase states

Feedback is not just numeric—it’s conceptual
