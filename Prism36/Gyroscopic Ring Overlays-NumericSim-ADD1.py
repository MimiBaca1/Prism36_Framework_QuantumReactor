## ADD 1 to Numeric Simulation: Gyroscopic Ring Overlays
# We’ll add concentric rings around the spherical shell to represent the outer gyroscopic field generators. These rings will be visualized as circular paths in 3D space.
# This adds three glowing rings around the equator—symbolizing rotational harmonic fields.
# Code Additions (to existing numerica simulation)

# Gyroscopic ring overlays
num_rings = 3
ring_radii = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3]  # Slightly larger than node radius
ring_colors = ['cyan', 'magenta', 'lime']

for r, color in zip(ring_radii, ring_colors):
    phi_ring = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
    x_ring = r * np.cos(phi_ring)
    y_ring = r * np.sin(phi_ring)
    z_ring = np.zeros_like(phi_ring)
    ax.plot(x_ring, y_ring, z_ring, color=color, linewidth=1.5, alpha=0.6)
