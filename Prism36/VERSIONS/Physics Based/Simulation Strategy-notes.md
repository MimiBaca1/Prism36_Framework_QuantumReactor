🔁 Simulation Strategy
🧩 1. 2D Sphere Model
What it simulates: A cross-section of the spherical plasma core

Why it’s useful: Easier to visualize radial flow, magnetic field lines, and resonance zones

Techniques:

Use polar coordinates 
(
𝑟
,
𝜃
)

Simulate plasma density, velocity, and magnetic field vectors

Apply simplified MHD equations in 2D

🌀 2. 2D Torus Model
What it simulates: A cross-section of a toroidal plasma loop (like a tokamak)

Why it’s useful: Models confinement, rotational flow, and magnetic pinch effects

Techniques:

Use toroidal coordinates or map onto a donut-shaped grid

Simulate circular plasma flow and magnetic field wrapping

Apply MHD with rotational symmetry

🔮 3. 3D Model
What it simulates: Full volumetric plasma behavior inside the Prism36 shell

Why it’s powerful: Captures full spatial dynamics, gyroscopic ring influence, and symbolic node interactions

Techniques:

Use spherical or cylindrical 3D grids

Simulate vector fields for velocity and magnetic flux

Visualize resonance zones, phase alignment, and energy flow
# Suggested Build Order
Start with 2D Sphere: Simple, elegant, and symbolic

Add 2D Torus: Introduces rotational confinement and flow

Evolve into 3D: Full symbolic plasma cognition engine
