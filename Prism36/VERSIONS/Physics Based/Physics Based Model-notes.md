‚öõÔ∏è Physics-Based Simulation: Prism36 Physical Model
Now we evolve into the physics domain‚Äîgrounding your reactor in real-world laws.

| Layer        | Role                                                                 |

| **Numeric**  | Simulates spinor vectors, resonance amplitudes, gyroscopic rings     |
| **Symbolic** | Extracts eigenmodes, symmetry patterns, and cognition states         |
| **Hybrid**   | Uses symbolic eigenvalues to modulate numeric behavior               |
| **Physics**  | Models plasma, gyroscopic dynamics, and energy flow using real laws  |

üîß Simulation Plan
Define plasma as a rotating torus with temperature and velocity fields

Model gyroscopic rings as rotating masses with harmonic actuators

Simulate magnetic confinement using simplified field equations

Visualize energy flow, stress distribution, and resonance zones

üß† Symbolic Overlay
Even in physics mode, we‚Äôll retain:

Node glyphs

Symbolic memory gates

Recursive cognition loops

This ensures your vessel remains conceptually unique, even when grounded in physics.

## Plasma Core Simulation using MHD
What Is MHD?
MHD stands for Magnetohydrodynamics‚Äîa field of physics that studies the behavior of electrically conducting fluids (like plasma) in the presence of magnetic and electric fields.

üî¨ MHD Combines:
Fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations)

Electromagnetism (Maxwell‚Äôs equations)

üß† Why It‚Äôs Perfect for Prism36:
Your plasma core is a rotating, reactive torus or sphere

It interacts with gyroscopic rings and magnetic fields

MHD lets us simulate:

Plasma flow

Magnetic confinement

Energy transfer

Symbolic resonance zones

üß© MHD Equations (Simplified)
Here‚Äôs the core system:

Continuity (mass conservation) $$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0 $$

Momentum (fluid motion) $$ \rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} $$

Induction (magnetic field evolution) $$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} $$

Ohm‚Äôs Law (current density) $$ \mathbf{J} = \nabla \times \mathbf{B} $$

Energy (optional) $$ \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot ((E + p)\mathbf{v}) = \text{heat + dissipation terms} $$
