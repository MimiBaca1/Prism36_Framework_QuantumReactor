Prism36 Math-Based Model
# 1. Node Geometry: Spherical Coordinates
We define 36 nodes on a unit sphere using spherical coordinates:

Each node 
𝑁
𝑖
 has:

𝜃
𝑖
∈
[
0
,
𝜋
]
 (polar angle)

𝜙
𝑖
∈
[
0
,
2
𝜋
]
 (azimuthal angle)

Cartesian conversion: $$ x_i = \sin(\theta_i) \cos(\phi_i), \quad y_i = \sin(\theta_i) \sin(\phi_i), \quad z_i = \cos(\theta_i) $$

This forms the Prism36 shell—a recursive spherical lattice.

# 2. Resonance Modeling: Spherical Harmonics
Each node’s resonance amplitude is modeled using spherical harmonics:

Let 
𝑌
ℓ
𝑚
(
𝜃
,
𝜙
)
 be the spherical harmonic of degree 
ℓ
 and order 
𝑚

Resonance amplitude at node 
𝑖
: $$ R_i = \Re\left[Y_\ell^m(\theta_i, \phi_i)\right] $$

This gives a harmonic field across the shell—ideal for symbolic cognition or plasma modulation.

3. Spinor Field: Tensor Representation
Define a spinor field 
𝜓
 as a 4-component column vector:

𝜓
=
[
𝜓
1
(
𝜃
,
𝜙
)
𝜓
2
(
𝜃
,
𝜙
)
𝜓
3
(
𝜃
,
𝜙
)
𝜓
4
(
𝜃
,
𝜙
)
]
Each component can be expanded in spherical harmonics or treated as a tensor field over the shell.

# 4. Symmetry Group: SU(2) or SO(3)
The Prism36 lattice exhibits rotational symmetry:

SO(3): 3D rotation group—describes global shell symmetry

SU(2): Spinor symmetry group—describes internal spinor transformations

We can define node transformations using group elements 
𝑔
∈
𝑆
𝑈
(
2
)
, acting on 
𝜓
 via:

𝜓
′
=
𝑔
⋅
𝜓
This models symbolic cognition loops, phase transitions, and mirrored verse traversal.

# 5. Eigenmode Extraction
We define a symbolic operator 
𝐿
 (e.g., Laplacian or Dirac operator) acting on 
𝜓
:

𝐿
𝜓
=
𝜆
𝜓
Solving this gives eigenvalues 
𝜆
 and eigenvectors 
𝜓
—representing resonance modes, degeneracies, and symbolic memory states.
