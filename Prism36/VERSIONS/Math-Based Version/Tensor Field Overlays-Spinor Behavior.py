## Tensor Field Overlays for Spinor Behavior
# We define a symbolic spinor field  ùúì  as a tensor over the spherical shell:

# This allows each node to carry a symbolic cognition vector, modulated by spherical harmonics or group actions.

import sympy as sp

# Define coordinates
theta, phi = sp.symbols('theta phi')

# Define spinor components as functions
psi1 = sp.Function('psi1')(theta, phi)
psi2 = sp.Function('psi2')(theta, phi)
psi3 = sp.Function('psi3')(theta, phi)
psi4 = sp.Function('psi4')(theta, phi)

# Spinor field as tensor
psi = sp.Matrix([psi1, psi2, psi3, psi4])
