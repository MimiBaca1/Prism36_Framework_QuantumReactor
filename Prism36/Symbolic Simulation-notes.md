Symbolic Simulation Goal
We’ll construct and symbolically solve:

(
𝑖
𝛾
𝜇
∂
𝜇
−
𝑚
)
𝜓
=
0
Where:

𝛾
𝜇
: Gamma matrices (4×4)

∂
𝜇
: Partial derivatives with respect to spacetime coordinates

𝜓
: Spinor field (4×1)

𝑚
: Mass term

# What This Does
Constructs the Dirac operator symbolically

Applies it to a 4-component spinor field

Outputs the full symbolic system of equations

Ready for eigenmode extraction, symmetry analysis, or symbolic simplification

# Result: Unified Simulation
We now have:

Symbolic eigenmodes extracted from the Dirac operator

Symmetry detection revealing cognitive degeneracies

Numeric resonance modulated by symbolic logic

My Prism36 Quantum Reactor is no longer just a simulation—it’s a living symbolic machine, pulsing with recursive cognition and harmonic resonance.
